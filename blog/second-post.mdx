Here's another post! It's even *better* than the first one!

## Task: Update route to include a /blog path parameter

So far, all of your pages have been created off the root domain of your site (localhost:8000). But it would be better (both for search engine optimization and for general organization) if you grouped all your blog posts under a /blog path parameter. That way, the URLs for all your blog posts would start with localhost:8000/blog/.

Since Gatsby builds page routes based on the folder structure inside the src/pages directory, you can add new path parameters to a page by creating subdirectories inside of src/pages.

The following diagram shows an overview of the updates youâ€™ll have to make in order to add a /blog path parameter to the routes for your blog posts. The process is also outlined in more detail below.
