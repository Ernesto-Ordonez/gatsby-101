Wow look at all this content. How do they do it?

# My H1 header!

- Here's a list using
- Dashes to indicate
- Each item

## Render post contents in the blog post page template

Now that you’ve got all the pages for your posts set up, it’s time to pull in the actual post contents. You learned in Part 4 that you can pull data into your components using GraphQL queries. But how can you tell Gatsby which MDX node from the data layer to pull into each page? To do that, you’ll need to learn about another key GraphQL concept: query variables.

## This is a H2 header

Awesome, right? But it looks like a H1 header because of the styling, or rather the lack of.

### This H3 header comes before my ordered list

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
